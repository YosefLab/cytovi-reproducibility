# Figure 5: Analysis of clinical flow cytometry samples from CLL patients
This folder contains the notebooks and scripts to integrate the clinical flow cytometry data for the reference dataset and perform transfer learning to predict patient diagnostics of unseen samples.  The folder is structured as following:

Notebooks:
- 5_1_CLL_analysis.ipynb: Notebook to reproduce the analysis of the CLL patients.
- 5_2_CLL_clonality_classifier.ipynb: Notebook to explore the light chain restriction of CLL clones, perform additional visualizations and train the decision tree classifier.

Scripts:
- 5_1_CLL_reference_model.py: Script train the flow cytometry model of the clinical CLL cohort.
